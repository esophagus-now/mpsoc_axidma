/*Below this write-up is skeleton of a simple character driver. In order
for it all to make sense, I've left this large comment block at the 
beginning to tell you what to look for. I've left extra discussions at
the end as well

To understand how to write a driver, we need to briefly go on a tangent.
Don't feel too intimidated by the size of the section: the large three
indented paragraphs can be skipped.

============================
THE VIRTUAL FILESYSTEM (VFS)
============================

What happens when you open, read, write, close, etc. a file? Normally, 
this triggers reads and writes to the hard drive, but Linux's design is 
actually much more intelligent.

The open() system call looks like this:

 int open(const char *pathname, int flags);

When you call this function, you give it a file path (as a string) as 
the first argument. (The flags are for saying whether you plan to read,
write, and whatever else you want). The Linux kernel will then take that 
string and look it up.

I don't want to get into too much detail, but the end goal of a file 
lookup is finding a data structure which is called "struct file". 
(defined in include/linux/fs.h in the kernel source tree). Believe it 
or not, your entire filesystem is essentially one big graph (i.e. a 
"nodes and edges" graph) made out of structs with pointers to other 
structs; eventually, by using bits and pieces of your filepath string, 
the kernel will traverse this representation of the filesystem in order 
to find your file.

	Yes, of course this is an oversimplification. Obviously this would
	consume a huge amount of RAM. Instead, the structs which make up
	the nodes of this graph contain pointers to functions. When the
	kernel wishes to traverse from part of the graph to another (for 
	example, suppose it is at the node that represents the "/home/tom"
	directory) it will call a specific one of those functions (for
	example, the function which scans all the edges coming out of a 
	directory node and returns a pointer to the one it was asked for [or
	in other words, findingg a file in a directory])
	
	Here's the key insight that makes the VFS so elegant and flexible:
	it is up to the designer of a filesystem to implement these functions.
	They can do anything the designer wants! They could just make the
	computer print out silly messages, or make the speakers beep.... or
	maybe access the disk drive. That's right: instead of keeping the 
	entire graph representing your filesystem in RAM, it is loaded from
	the disk whenever you traverse an edge between nodes. The kernel is 
	very smart about keeping a certain number of node structs cached in 
	RAM based on what you're accessing most often (otherwise performance
	would be terrible)
	
	And this is how different filesystems are implemented. The NTFS 
	filesystem code will essentially read certain bytes from the hard 
	drive and fill up node structures (called inodes) as the kernel asks
	for them. The ext4 driver does the exact same thing (although the
	on-disk representation of ext4 closely matches the in-memory 
	representation of inodes, and this no accident; the ext4 driver
	doesn't have to do much more than load the data into memory). When it
	comes to in-memory filesystems like /proc and /sysfs, the inodes are
	literally always stored in RAM and traversing them is a simple 
	pointer dereference.

It turns out that a struct file contains a struct file_operations in it.
The definition of struct file_operations is in include/linux/fs.h in the
kernel source tree, and an excert is shown here:

	struct file_operations {
		struct module *owner;
		int (*open) (struct inode *, struct file *);
		loff_t (*llseek) (struct file *, loff_t, int);
		ssize_t (*read) (struct file *, char __user *, size_t, loff_t *);
		ssize_t (*write) (struct file *, const char __user *, size_t, loff_t *);
		__poll_t (*poll) (struct file *, struct poll_table_struct *);
		int (*mmap) (struct file *, struct vm_area_struct *);
		int (*release) (struct inode *, struct file *);
		//... and about 20 other  function pointers
	}

Here's the kicker: when you do any one of the open(), read(), write(), 
etc. system calls related to a specific file, the kernel will eventually
call the function specified in the file_operations struct. If you wanted,
every file could do different things when you read it.

That's where character drivers come in: we will be adding a file to the
filesystem (yes, you can see it in your file manager) but we will supply
our own functions. That way, whenever a user opens the file, it will
call out open function. When the user reads, it calls our read function,
and so on. Importantly, our functions run in the kernel, with full 
permission to do whatever we want with the hardware.


============================================
THE BASIC PARTS OF A CHARACTER DEVICE DRIVER
============================================

We want to do three things:

1) Make our own open, read, write, etc. functions that will do something
interesting

2) Add a new file into the filesystem whose file operations point to our
interesting functions

3) Put all this into a dynamically loadable kernel module

To do 1), we'll define all the functions we plan to make, and slot them 
into a file operations struct. 

To do 2), we will put our file operations struct and some metadata 
(like the filename and file permissions we want) into a miscdevice 
struct. This struct is used in a call to misc_device_register, and 
provides it with all the information it needs to create the device 
file. The file will be in both /dev and in /sys/class/misc, with the 
name and permissions we asked for. 

To do 3), we have to write a module init and module exit function, 
which are called when the module is loaded and unloaded from the kernel 
(respectively). To tell the compiler which of our functions are these 
special module-related functions, we use some black magic macros from 
<linux/module.h>. We also use some macros to add module metadata (such 
as license and author info)

//from the file operations struct

		printk(KERN_ALERT "Opened our device file! Everything looks okay!\n");
	} else {
		printk(KERN_ERR "Opened our device file, but something looks wrong...\n");
	}
	
	//Most open functions you write will typically keep track of how 
	//many people are usign a device file. For most io devices, you 
	//usually only want one process using them at a time; you can
	//return -EBUSY;
	//to have any new openers of your device file fail their open call
	
	return 0; //SUCCESS
}

static int our_release (struct inode *inode, struct file *filp) {
	printk(KERN_ALERT "Thank you for using our device driver!\n");
	
	return 0;
}

//read() and write() functions are definitely more complicated. For
//starters, the pointer passed as the second argument is a pointer into
//the user's virtual memory area, which means we CANNOT dereference it!
//This example just returns "Lorem Ipsum" into the buffer indicated by
//the user in order to show how to move data to userspace safely
static ssize_t our_read (struct file *filp, char __user *buf, size_t sz, loff_t *off) {
	//The first parameter is our own file pointer. I'm not sure what we
	//would do with it, to be honest
	
	//The second paramater is a userspace virtual address which, for them,
	//pointe to a memory buffer they want us to read into
	
	//The third parameter is the number of bytes they are trying to read
	
	//The fourth parameter is the offset. See, when a user calls read 
	//over and over again, they expect to be reading sequentially through

	//message in parts (and without going out of bounds)
	int sz_left = (int)msg_len - (int)*off; //Casting to int for safety
	
	//Pick the minimum of sz or sz_left
	int sz_to_send = (int) sz > sz_left ? sz_left : sz;
	
	if (sz_to_send <= 0) {
		//The user has read the entire message. First, reset the offset...

////////////////// PART 2: CREATING THE DEVICE FILES ///////////////////

//This struct contains all the details needed to hook up our operations
//to a real file in the filesystm

	.minor = MISC_DYNAMIC_MINOR, 
	.name = "our_driver",
	.fops = &our_fops,

//Something I haven't talked about yet: every device file has unique 
//device numbers. They consist of a "major number" and a "minor number",
//and you can see them if you do ls -l on a device file. For example,
/*
 * $ ls -l /dev/sda1 
 * brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 1 Oct 18 21:41 /dev/sda1
 */
//This tells me the /dev/sda1 device file has major number 8 and minor
//number 1. Honestly, I'm not really sure how these are used by the 
//kernel, but as far as I know they're used to associate a device file 
//with the driver that controls it. In this case, our device file will
//actually share the same major number as all the other misc drivers on
//the system, but it can choose its own minor number. I don't care what
//my device number is, so I just ask misc_driver_register to choose one
//for me

//By the way, the mode field of this struct is the permissions for the 
//file. Note we use the rarely-seen octal prefix!

//The next step is to actually register our driver. This will be done in
//the module init function in the next section. However, we need to keep
//track of when we have been succesfully registered or not:
static int registered = 0;

/////////////////// PART 3: MAKING IT INTO A MODULE ////////////////////

//memory used for this function once it is run. Init functions are only
//ever run once, so there's no need to keep them around

// EXTRA NOTES
// -----------

/*
(See next note for compilation details)

To use this module, I recommend opening a separate terminal and running
$ dmesg -w
which will give you a live view of kernel messages.

Then in a separate terminal, run:
$ sudo insmod our_device.ko
$ cat /dev/our_device
$ sudo rmmod our_device
*/

/*
As hinted earlier, compiling modules is not a simple job; the machine 
code has to be put together in a very particular way. Luckily, the 
kernel developers have come up with a relatively painless way to do 
this; they have a special makefile that comes with your kernel, which 
takes care of doing the really complicated stuff. I don't really know 
the details of using it, but for simple drivers, it looks like this:

	# If KERNELRELEASE is defined, we've been invoked from the 
	# kernel build system and can use its language. 
	ifneq ($(KERNELRELEASE),) 
		obj-m := NAME_OF_YOUR_C_FILE.o 
	# Otherwise we were called directly from the command 
	# line; invoke the kernel build system. 
	else 
		KERNELDIR ?= /usr/lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build 
		PWD := $(shell pwd) 

	default: 
		$(MAKE) -C $(KERNELDIR) M=$(PWD) modules 

	clean:
		$(MAKE) -C $(KERNELDIR) M=$(PWD) clean
		
	endif

Using misc drivers really makes life easier. Without it, you have to do 
a ton of really annoying extra steps, like allocating your own device 
nnumber, filling in a bunch of annoyign structs, calling several 
registration functions, error-checking each one, of course...

conventional method:

#include <linux/fs.h> //alloc_chrdev_region, etc.
